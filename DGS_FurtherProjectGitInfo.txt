Hi there.

Let´s start;

1) First, go to: https://github.com and create your account.

2) Then, go to https://desktop.github.com and download the GIT app

3) Now, goes to https://git-lfs.github.com download and install as well

4) After all that, go to: https://github.com/filipetessaro/DGS_FurtherProject
click the gree button: "Clone or download" and select to "Open in Desktop.

5) GitAPP will open automatically, if you created your account in github.com, it should connect automatically as well
Select a folder to be your local repository and click in clone.

6) Get a coffe, it is about 20GB of content...

7) Also download and install UE4.21

8) Check all the assets we have and have tons of fun :)
Most contents I removed the Example and Overview Maps to decrease the project size. If you want I can send it to you separated.


9) To be able to send commits to the server, you need to be a colaborator, if so, send me your git acc name so I can add you

PS: Massive amount of wet/licking/messy kisses! :)
